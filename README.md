 ## Documentation
- (As generally english is used in coding-readme documentations, we decided to make this file in english)

- Login, Sign Up and "Privatsphäre" Links in Nav Bar and Footer are purposely disfunctional, since no login page etc. has been created (yet)

- GRIDS: Most elements were made in  various different grid layouts like e.g. the hero section of the homepage(see styles.css)

- FLEXBOXES: Some elements are made with flexboxes like e.g. the nav bar (see styles.css)

- RESPONSIVENESS: Media querries were used and elements customized for mobile/tablet view in portait aswell as landscape mode (see  
styles.css), furthermore sizing was made whenever possible with sizing "vw" and "vh".

- VIDEO: Has been implemented in about (Über uns) page

- W3 VALIDATOR: Page has been validated and further more tested with lighthouse

- font-colors are set with classes from the css/styles.css file (e.g. class="orange")-choices are orange, yellow, green, blue, pink

- backgroundcolors are set with classes from the css/styles.css file and end in bg (e.g. class="orangebg") - choices are orangebg, yellowbg, greenbg, bluebg, pinkbg

- grids are set with classes from the css/styles.css file e.g. class="two-row-grid-1-2" here the first "two" mentions that it has 2 rows and 1-2 siginifies that 1st row to the second has a 1 to 2 aspect ratio.

- class .hide and .hideqr hides things  on mobile and tablet view. Like e.g. the qr code to scan on mobile and tablet since the pages is viewed on a mobibile/tablet.

- images with excpectations of the favicon were all implemented as webp  format. To ensure maximum responsiveness and even fit the requirements of a 4k ultra wide screen, pictures are set to 500 x 500 pixels, but most of them are less than 10 kb. (2-3 pictures are 200-500kb)


## SOURCES(QUELLEN)

### GENERAL
Some elements in navbar and footer have been reused from old projects that Thomas Buser did in his free time. In those old projects ChatGPT, stackoverflow.com, w3schools.com, codepen.com aswell as other websites have been used as aid to create that code.

Some other smaller elements and some code fragments like e.g. the outdated browser checker has been resued from old pojects of Thomas Buser. They contain code fragments that have been made with aid ChatGPT, stackoverflow.com, w3schools.com, codepen.com aswell as other websites.

Gradient has been made with a gradient generator (https://cssgradient.io/)

codepen.com, stackoverflow.com, w3schools.com were aswell used to create new code

### USE OF AI:
Some codefragments have been created or modified with AI. Mainly ChatGPT(http://https://chat.openai.com/) and Github Copilot (https://github.com/features/copilot) were used as AI models. Mostly for purpose of efficiency AI was used (e.g. "Co-Pilot make a double div container first div with class two-row-grid"). Sometimes if a question arised to solve a problem AI was used (e.g."Co-pilot explain me why this container isn't on the right hand side even though margin-left is set to auto").
AI was aswell used to w3 validate the code. Herefor a symbiosis of the w3 validate plugin and Github Co-Pilot was used.
